	            <p><span style="font-size: 35px; line-height: 1; margin-right: 3px;">S</span>PRINGFIELD – Many things have changed at the Academy of Arts and Academics since last school year when a police investigation revealed that longtime principal, Mike Fisher, had sexually abused a former student beginning when she was just 14.</p>
<p>He was placed on administrative leave Jan. 31 and subsequently killed himself one day later, leaving the school’s staff, students and community to pick up the pieces.</p>
<p>And they have.</p>
<p>The former charter school, which was previously overseen by a volunteer governing board, is now a high school managed by the Springfield Public Schools district. A class period has been added to the school day and a new principal has been hired, but the teacher ranks and student body have shrunken since last winter.</p>
<p>Despite the changes, however, the school has retained many of its eclectic classes that allow students to gain a high school degree while exploring their interests in arts and sciences.</p>
<p>Still, there’s apprehension.</p>
<p>“I’m a little worried about how new everything is and how the new schedule is going to work,” said Marissa Morse, a 17-year-old senior at the school. “Without some of our beloved staff members, I genuinely don’t know how students are going to react. There’s going to be some anger I think, but I’m hoping that this year will be a little better.”</p>
<p>The revelations of the last school year were heavy and difficult to grapple with and many students, staff and administrators described feelings of despair, anger, betrayal and hurt.</p>
<p>“As things progressed and we began to learn more about the accusations against Mike, I felt a deep sense of betrayal of my core values as an educator,” longtime A3 teacher Andy Hock said in a recent interview at the school. “We don’t take a hypocritic oath like doctors do, but our core mission as teachers is to improve the lives of students, so for him to what he did was devastating.”</p>
<p>But according to Hock and a few other passionate teachers, students and administrators, “the worst is now behind them” and the 2018-19 school year will allow for a fresh start.</p>
<p>“Every person is at a different phase of this process,” Hock said. “But the way I’m processing it is to ensure that we protect what is good about A3 and make it better going forward. It’s critical to protect what’s special about this place.”</p>        	</div>

<p>Following the initial shock and trauma of last winter’s events, there was a lot of uncertainty about what might happen to the school, its Springfield district charter status, its students and whether it would continue to exist.</p>
<p>Then, in March, the Springfield district, through which A3 was chartered, announced it would take control of the school, also known as A3, and its charter status, as well as its independent governing board were dissolved. The school was briefly reclassified as an alternative high school, and most recently a “regular high school” and there were many questions about what the school might look like going forward.</p>
<p>“As teachers, our main worry was, ‘OK, how are we going to help students manage this?’” Hock said. “How are we going to lead students and teachers through this? But also the logistical part of ‘school still has to go on, there are 90 kids that have to graduate in June.’”</p>
<p>About 320 students were enrolled at A3 last school year which offered an alternative to a regular comprehensive high school and was well-known in the district for its unique programming. Some of those programs included “J-term,” a month-long “mini-term” that takes place during the month of January. As part of the program, students have the option to take day-long specialized intensive classes and get to combine academics with artistic pursuits in lieu of a regular class schedule, except for math.</p>
<p>Students were also worried about whether “Confluence” would still be available. Confluence takes place at the end of each semester during which students produce and participate in public demonstrations that feature work from their arts and academics classes.</p>
<p>To the relief of many, both programs will still be in place this upcoming school year.</p>
<p>“I really believe in the programming that A3 offers and the community is really behind it,” new A3 principal Ame Beard said in a recent interview. “I very much love the tradition that has been put together by the staff and students here, and I really believe that that’s going to be something we need to continue to support because it’s the right thing to do for the school community.”</p>        	</div>

<p>Enrollment is slightly down at the school, with about 50 fewer students signed up to begin classes at A3 in September. Although much of the programming has remained the same, there have been a few changes.</p>
<p>Only about 85 percent of the teaching staff from last school year will still be teaching at A3 for the 2018-19 school year. Many students last spring voiced concern about their teachers and whether they would be able to stay on staff.</p>
<p>“Some move out of the area and some transferred to different districts, but we tried to retain as many as possible,” Springfield district spokeswoman Jen McCulley said.</p>
<p>McCulley said the district worked closely with the state to get various teachers the correct licensure to remain at the school and continue teaching.</p>
<p>Last school year there were 24 staff members who were considered “guest artists” who were not licensed teachers. Charter schools in Oregon can hire such employees to serve as teachers, as they are not required to follow most state and school district education laws, regulations and policies.</p>
<p>There were also 11 certified teachers employed at the school last year.</p>
<p>This year there are 27 staff members, 21 of which are teachers. The other six positions are filled by the principal, custodial staff, registrar, secretary and campus monitor.</p>
<p>Because there are fewer teachers, there’s been some shuffling of educator time, with some teachers taking on either multiple subjects or multiple class periods. Because the school was switched from a charter high school to a comprehensive high school, there were some logistical issues to solve such as making sure that students receive the appropriate amount of time in each common core class such as math, English and science.</p>
<p>“All of the same programming that makes A3, A3 is still there,” said Springfield district spokeswoman Jen McCulley. “How we offer it has changed a little.”</p>
<p>Crafting a new class period schedule that met all state and district requirements while also trying maintain much of the programming considered so important at the school was a challenge, according to Beard.</p>
<p>“Usually the process of putting together a master schedule at a comprehensive high school takes about nine months,” Beard said. “We obviously didn’t have that time frame, so myself and some staff members with the input of some students worked through the summer to come up with something that we think will work.”</p>        	</div>

	            <p><strong>Rebuilding is a process -- subhead</strong></p>
<p>For many in the A3 school community, last year’s events prompted a lot of anger, sadness and feelings of uncertainty.</p>
<p>And although it’s a new school year and there’s a new principal in charge, Beard said she’s “well aware” that the events that transpired last year are still being processed by many.</p>
<p>“Everyone here has been super supportive and helpful as we work to transition to a new school year, but I recognize that healing will take time and it’ll be a process,” Beard said. “I want to continue to be a person who advocates strongly for the programming that’s happening here while at the same time holding space for people to be able to be able to process not only any changes they may anticipate but also the healing process as they are able to get back to work and school in a positive way.”</p>
<p>As for teacher Hock, he said throwing himself into the work has helped him to heal.</p>
<p>“I’ve said ‘yes’ to everything I’ve been asked to help with,” Hock said. “Whether that’s parent meetings, listening sessions, helping out with the schedule, whatever it may be, I’m here for it.”</p>
<p>But Hock admits that there’s still more work to be done, and he’s ready for it.</p>
<p>“What we’re essentially trying to do is rebuild the airplane in flight,” Hock said. “And we’re going to do it because we have to. This school means so much to so many people, and it provides something for students that not every school can provide.”</p>
<p>Hock said in a recent interview that he was eager to see students walk through the school doors again.</p>
<p>“The best way to deal with this for me personally, is to put my energy into the work, into my students,” Hock said. “I wish I could tell you that all of the questions have been answered, but we’re working on it, and I’m going to be here for them.”</p>
<p>Many at A3 and in the Springfield community can agree that there’s much work to still be done, but there’s also a renewed sense of hope and positivity created in part by the staff that seems to be slowing seeping into the school.</p>
<p>“Really, I feel like we can only go up from here,” Beard said. “What happened was terrible, and difficult, but we’re moving forward and we’re rebuilding.”</p>

	            <p>When police and school district documents revealed last spring that former Academy of Arts and Academics principal Mike Fisher had been having a sexual relationship with a former student, there were many concerns about how the allegations came to light and what sort of safeguards are in place to keep it from happening again.</p>
<p>Despite the severity of Fisher’s actions, there have not been any major policy changes within the Springfield district, as policies regarding reporting abuse are based on state laws that were already in place in Springfield district last year.</p>
<p>Educators, regardless of whether they work at a private or public school, are required by law to report any reasonable suspicion of abuse or neglect. If a student comes to them with reports of potential sexual abuse, school employees are required to report that information to police or the state Department of Human Services. The suspected abuse doesn’t have to have taken place on campus or at a school-related activity. Mandatory reporting is a 24-hour obligation, meaning that information about suspected abuse or neglect of a child must be reported regardless of whether knowledge of the abuse was gained in the reporter’s official capacity.</p>
<p>In addition, educators are told not to try to investigate allegations of abuse on their own but to immediately report such suspicions and let police and other law enforcement officials take over.</p>
<p>The biggest change that came about because of the Fisher scandal, is that the district now has complete control of A3, which also means that should any suspicious behavior be witnessed by school staff, there’s only one place to make a report, according to district officials. Everyone knows who their supervisor is, and who to report to if something seems off.</p>
<p>“Now, every person who works at A3 is a district employee,” Springfield district spokeswoman Jen McCulley said. “There’s a single avenue of reporting in lieu of going to different set of staff when there’s an issue. It streamlines that process.”</p>
<p><strong>Abuse prevention training</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of each school year, educators in Oregon are required to complete training on how to spot potential sexual conduct, harassment, abuse and grooming and how to report it. All school district employees are required to take the training</p>
<p>Students in Oregon are also educated about child sex abuse and prevention.</p>
<p>The Oregon Legislature in 2015 passed Senate Bill 856 that mandates schools to provide child sexual abuse prevention instruction for students in grades kindergarten through 12. Each school in every district is also required to adopt a child sexual abuse prevention instructional program which is “complete, balanced and medically accurate,” according to the State Department of Education.</p>
<p>The curriculum must be age appropriate and adjusted based by grade level. For example, young students in kindergarten and first grade learn about personal space while middle and high school-age students learn about healthy relationships and teen dating violence.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 856 required that educators provide a minimum of four instruction hours equal or greater than a standard class period of sex abuse prevention instruction per year for all grades K-12.</p>

Everyone knows who their supervisor is, and who to report to if something seems off.</p>
<p>Previously, it was unclear whether anyone was supervising Fisher.</p>
<p>From 2005 to 2010, A3 was a magnet/alternative high school and therefore completely controlled by the district. During that time, it would have been the responsibility of Fisher’s supervisor, a district employee, to ensure that Fisher was being evaluated annually.</p>
